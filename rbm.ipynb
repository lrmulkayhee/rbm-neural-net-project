    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The task involves reconstructing noisy numeral images (digits 0-7) represented as 10x10 binary matrices. Each pixel is either active (1) or inactive (0). The primary challenges include:\n",
    "- **Noise**: Distortions in the input images make it difficult to recover the original numeral patterns.\n",

    "- **Hidden Units**: 150 units, which capture latent features and patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
